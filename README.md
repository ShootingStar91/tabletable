# Tabletable

Customizable, sortable, filterable table-component.

Built on CSS grid, React, Typescript. 

Idea is to have features such as

* JSX or strings/numbers in cells and headers
* Filtering and sorting based on either cell value or a custom value getter
* Data export to CSV / other formats
* Pagination

[Actual component](src/TableTable/index.tsx) is in TableTable-folder, [App.tsx](src/App.tsx) contains minimum setup for testing.
