# Tabletable

Customizable, sortable, filterable table-component.

Built on CSS grid, React, Typescript. 

Idea is to have features such as

- [x] JSX or strings/numbers in cells and headers
- [x] Filtering sorting based on either cell value or a custom value getter
- [x] Pagination
- [ ] Same with filtering
- [ ] Data export to CSV / other formats
- [ ] Easy-to-customize styles

Possible further features

- [ ] Columns can be made clickable to fold/unfold
- [ ] First column can be made sticky
- [ ] First row can be made sticky (showing total values, possibly affected by filters/sorts)

[Actual component](src/TableTable/index.tsx) is in TableTable-folder, [App.tsx](src/App.tsx) contains minimum setup for testing.
